## Creating a new project via Cargo

`cargo new project_name` -This will create a new rust project setup for git

### Cool Commands for Cargo (Must be in Cargo Directory to use)

`cargo build`  - Builds current Cargo project, must cd to executable and execute manually

`cargo run` - Builds and executes Cargo Project (cooler option)

`cargo check` - Checks if code is compilable without creating an executable

`cargo build --release` - Builds optimized (hopefully final) code. Takes longer to compile
